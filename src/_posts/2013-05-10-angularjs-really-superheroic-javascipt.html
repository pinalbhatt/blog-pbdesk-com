<p style="text-align: justify;">Updated on 30th Aug, 2014 - AngularJS 1.3.0-rc.0 is Out.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The day Apple said it will not support plugins like Flash Player, Silverlight for its iOS based devices, new revolution</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">started giving momentum to HTML5 and in turn JavaScript.  And JavaScript has evolved a lot in recent years. Hundreds of libraries and framework are now in market to work with it. Till I can remember, <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> was the first which became popular for its simple DOM manipulation APIs and excellent cross browser support. Then started coming up lot of other javascript utilities covering various patterns of javascript usage.  One of them was data-binding and templating , leading  to SPAs</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first one I came across  was <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a> – It was really simple and great in terms of getting MVC(or MVVM) pattern with HTML/Javascript, but some how I was not happy with its “ko.observable” code and started looking for alternates. And came across <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank"><strong><em>AngularJS</em></strong></a> – simply Awesome and really Super Heroic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS By Google – In true sense Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework. It just took me away. Now I am really in love with it. Though it has stiff learning curve, but in real sense it’s a Framework. The more I go deep into it the more and more I am becoming fan of it.</p>

<h2>Why AngularJS?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Read on to find out how.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike other frameworks, there is no need to inherit from proprietary types; to wrap the model in accessors methods. Just plain old JavaScript here. This makes your code easy to test, maintain, reuse, and again free from boilerplate.</p>
