<p align="justify">Google is simply getting awesome day by day. Though I am a Microsoft guy and still a Microsoft lover, slowly i have started developing fondness for Google.</p>
<p align="justify">Google - synonym for search - is not only a search engine now,&#160; it is much beyond search. <em>GMail</em>, <em>Google Talk</em>, <em>iGoogle</em>, <em>Google Maps</em>, <em>Google&#160; Earth</em>, <em>Google Toolbar</em>, <em>Google Docs</em>, <em>Blogger</em> are already there which have become common and have facilitated us since long. But still&#160; slowly and gradually Google is bringing tools to engage us. </p>
<p align="justify">Other Google apps that have fascinated me are <em>Google Reader</em>, <em>Google Calendar</em> &amp; <em>Google Notebook</em>. I will simply say awesome for these tools and now they are part and parcel of my daily life. And now the newer one&#160; “<em>SideWiki</em>”&#160; is goint to hit&#160; us.&#160; Also I am eagerly waiting for Google Waves. </p>
<p align="justify">I was expecting a lot from Microsoft Live, but frankly speaking i am disappointed. But still good parts of MS-Live are SkyDrive &amp; Office Live. And i am still waiting for Microsoft's Office Web Apps. I am really excited about it and hope its able to bring me back from Google Docs.</p>
<p align="justify">One of the good things I like in Google is Tagging/Labeling functionality rather then arranging items into folders. In this way an item can stay in more then one folder. And obviously internal search is always there with almost all Google tools, after all its Google!</p>
<p align="justify">But still Google is very poor in case of&#160; Bookmarking, no where near to Delicious. Looking forward to have good Social Bookmarking features from Google. Also it need to do a lot in case of Social Networking.... frankly speaking i am not a fan of &quot;Orkut&quot;, here Facebook is excellent.</p>
<p align="justify">Picasa &amp; You Tube are again excellent. Now that my Samsung's P3600 Blu-ray player is directly able to stream from You Tube …… i am going crazy.</p>
<p align="justify">Still I need to explore Google Books, let me see if I can find books on latest Microsoft technologies,&#160; otherwise :( for Google Books.</p>
<p align="justify">Any way, Google, thanks &amp; keep it up, you are taking up at least 1 to 2 hours of my daily time… hummm to expensive.</p>
