    Jade - Template Engine for NodeJS. Jade is a cool, elegant, high-performance (and probably the most used) templating
    language for Node focused on enabling quick HTML coding. It has been influenced by <a href="http://haml-lang.com/" target="_blank">HAML</a>.
    And its the default rendering engine for the <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">express web framework</a>.

<p>Here is a simple & beautiful video tutorial series from YouTube!, on Jade covering almost all aspects of Jade. Yes this was the turorial from where I laid my Jade Fundation.</p>
<h3>Top Speed HTML Development With Jade</h3>
<p>If you’re not using Jade, you’re missing out on some of the fastest HTML you’ll ever write, as well as boilerplate templating methods that will slash your development time in half. In Top-Speed HTML Development With Jade, you’ll learn how to generate full HTML from quick and easy shorthand. You’ll then build on that foundation to create infinitely reusable templates so you never again have to write the same code twice.</p>
