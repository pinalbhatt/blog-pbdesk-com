<p>Since last few days I am trying my hands with NodeJS. I came across very nice article "<a href="http://clock.co.uk/blog/a-simple-website-in-nodejs-with-express-jade-and-stylus" target="_blank">A SIMPLE WEBSITE IN NODE.JS WITH EXPRESS, JADE AND STYLUS</a>" by Ben Gourley. Really simple and easy startup.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/pbdesk/status/496729892328071170</p>
<p>Taking this article as base, I implemented same using #NTVS (Node.js Tools for Visual Studio) using #VS2013. <span style="color: #333333;">Modified code to use latest versions of dependencies for express, jade &amp; stylus. Like with Express 4.0, all middleware (except static) have been removed and will need to be called separately, 'logger' needs to be exchanged with 'morgan'. Here is nice post on <a href="http://scotch.io/bar-talk/expressjs-4-0-new-features-and-upgrading-from-3-0" target="_blank">ExpressJS 4.0: New Features and Upgrading from 3.0</a>. </span></p>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>[stextbox id="black"]Entire running source code with Visual Studio solution &amp; project files can found at <a title="NodeJS-Simple-WebSite Branch:clock" href="https://github.com/pbdesk/NodeJS-Simple-WebSite/tree/clock" target="_blank">Github</a>[/stextbox]</p>

<p>Here are code snippets for main files, all other files in public and views folder remain same as mention in above blog post.</p>
