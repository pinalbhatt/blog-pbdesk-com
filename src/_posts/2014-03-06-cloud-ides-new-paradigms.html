<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #222222;">Did anybody ever imagined that one day Javascript will be one of the most hottest  language on the planet!!! But yes that is the fact today. Javascript is the language that can be used in all aspects of development including client side, server side, database and even mobile apps. In other words one can't ignore it in today's realm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the advent of Javascript, web pages (web sites and web applications) have become so dynamic that now people have started writing IDE types of apps using javascript.  The whole new paradigm of  Online - Web Based - Cloud Based IDE has evolved.</p>
