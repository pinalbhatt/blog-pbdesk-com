<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, in Summer 2014, Microsoft announced the preview availability of its new <a href="http://www.asp.net/vnext" target="_blank">ASP.Net vNext</a>, that is MVC 6.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ASP.NET vNext is a lean and composable framework for building web and cloud applications. MVC, Web API, and Web Pages are merged into one framework, called MVC 6</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My previous post  regarding what's new in ASP.Net MVC 6 provides more details about features and acrchituctural changes in  MVC 6.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some official videos from Channel 9! giving sneak peek to ASP.Net MVC 6.</p>
<h3>ASP.NET Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Keynote at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf" target="_blank">dotnetConf 2014</a> by <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Scott-Hunter" target="_blank">Scott Hunter</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> It's been an amazing decade for ASP.NET. Today in 2014, most all of ASP.NET is open source, developed in the open, and accepting community contributions. One ASP.NET and VS 2013 added some amazing new tooling enhancements for HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. VS2013.3 is coming soon with even more innovations as we march towards ASP.NET vNext. Join Scott Hunter as he shows you how it works together. What's available on ASP.NET today, and where is ASP.NET headed tomorrow, and what do you need to know to best support the code you've written and the code you will write. We'll also talk about the rise of the cloud and how it changes the way we write large systems. All this, plus a lot of open source, and deploying to Azure.</p>

<h3>ASP.NET MVC 6 (now with integrated Web API!)</h3>
<p>By  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/daniel-roth" target="_blank">Daniel Roth</a> | <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf" target="_blank">dotnetConf 2014</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API in ASP.NET vNext are becoming one singular framework: ASP.NET MVC 6. Join Daniel Roth as he shows how to create great ASP.NET web apps that serve both pages and services. First we'll see how to build OData v4 compliant services using ASP.NET Web API 2.2 and the new attribute routing features available in ASP.NET MVC 5.2. Then we'll take a look at how ASP.NET MVC and Web API are being combined into a single framework, ASP.NET MVC 6, for handling all of your Web UI and services. We'll learn how to use ASP.NET MVC and Web APIs in ASP.NET vNext to support connected applications for browsers, Windows Phone, Windows Store and more!</p>

<h3>ASP.NET Identity</h3>
<p>By <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/pranav-rastogi" target="_blank">Pranav Rastogi</a> | <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf" target="_blank">dotnetConf 2014</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> ASP.NET Identity is a totally rewritten framework that brings the ASP.NET membership system into the modern era. ASP.NET Identity makes it easier to integrate different authentication systems such as local username, password as well as social logins such as Facebook, Twitter etc. It also gives you greater control over persisting data to your backend technology of choice. ASP.NET Identity is a game changer by bringing in more modern authentication systems such as Two-Factor Authentication. You can use ASP.NET Identity to secure Web Apps as well as Web APIs.</p>
