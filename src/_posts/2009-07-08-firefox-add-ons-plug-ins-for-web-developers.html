<p><b>Mozilla Firefox</b> - I love this browser. Though I don't use most! Yes I am a .Net guy so mostly I am on IE and IE8 is much better now. Any way here in this post I want to tell about FireFox and mainly about the Add-ons / plugins / extensions available for FireFox. There are thousands of add-ons available for FF(you can find them <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox" target="_blank">here</a>), but here I am listing only few of them which I mostly use as a web developer.</p>
<p>Latest stable version of Fire Fox : 3.5 (release date: 30-June-2009).     <br />To read more about version histroy visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Firefox" target="_blank">here</a>.      <br />Official website for firefox is <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mozilla.com</a>. You can find more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox" target="_blank">FireFox at Wikipedia</a>. </p>
<p>Coming to the point, lets discuss about the add-ons that are mostly used by web developers:</p>
<div>
<div>Firebug</div>
<div>
<p>Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of web development tools at your fingertips while you browse. You can edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;web development evolved&quot; - rightly said at official site of Firebug <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">http://getfirebug.com</a>. </li>
<li>Can be downloaded from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
<li>Version history and its compatibility with FireFox version can be found <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/1843" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
<li>Firebug is free and open source (BSD) </li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
<p>If you are a webdeveloper you simply cannot miss this tool. Excellent, awsome, amazing, great, wow whatever you want to say you can say it. It improves productivity of a web developer to a great extent by CSS &amp; JS debugging features. No doubt one of the most important business tool used by development companies.</p>
<p>I mainly use it for tracing CSS issues. JS debugging is really great feature but i like it better in IE8 web developer tools. Besides this firebug has many worth fetures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily accessable via F12 key. </li>
<li>Faclity to inspect and edit HTML and explore the DOM </li>
<li>Inspecting CSS, tweaking CSS on the fly to perfection </li>
<li>Debug and profile JavaScript, execute JavaScript on the fly, logging for JavaScript </li>
<li>Monitor network activity </li>
</ul>
