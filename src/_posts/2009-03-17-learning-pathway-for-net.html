<p>Just as in life, you need to know at least one language of communication for your survival, to swim the ocean of .Net you need to know at least one .Net programming language. Of the many .Net programming languages you need to learn and master at least one of them. And on the whole your major choice is going to be between <span style="font-weight: bold">C#</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">Visual Basic</span>.</p>
<p><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>So taking first step towards learning .Net, you need to decide for the core programming language: C# or VB or some other……, but we are going to focus on VB &amp; C# only, for other .Net languages you may ‘Google’ <span></span>further……</p>
<p><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Deciding between C# &amp; VB</span> : These both the languages are almost at par to each other, yet for more comparative study you may refer to my blog &quot;<a href="http://www.p-bhatt.com/2008/11/c-vs-vb.html" target="_blank">Comparing &amp; Contrasting C# &amp; VB</a>”. But <i>as a thumb rule for beginners : <u>if you are good at syntax and styles of C, C++ or Java – C# is the language for you</u> where as <u>if you are more familiar with Visual Basic 6 or BASIC programming languages – VB that is to say VB.Net is the solution for you</u>.</i> Eventually you can target to master both.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">First Step</span> : So your first step towards learning .Net is to choose a programming language using which you can make an entry point into .Net universe.</p>
<p>For those who choose for C# : here is the <a href="http://www.p-bhatt.com/2008/02/index-index-goes-here.html">Learning Pathway for C#</a>.</p>
<p>And for those who choose for VB : here is the <a href="http://www.p-bhatt.com/2007/12/image-demo.html">Learning Pathway for VB</a>.</p>
<p>Now at this point of time I would like to divide your .Net learning pathway into three levels :</p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: verdana">(i) Beginner Level,        <br />(ii) Intermediate Level and         <br />(iii) Advanced Level</span></b></p>
<p>Here is the complete <a href="http://www.p-bhatt.com/2007/12/net-learning-track.html">.Net Learning curve</a>.</p>
